## 1. Converting Image Files to Ordered Lists

**Description:** 

The script `convert_images_to_lists.py` allows you to convert a folder containing image files into an ordered list. It renames the image files in numerical order and creates an HTML file with an ordered list of image links.

**Usage:**

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place all the image files you want to convert into a folder.
3. Update the script `convert_images_to_lists.py` with the path to your folder.
4. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python convert_images_to_lists.py
    ```

5. Once the script completes, you will find all the images with the ordered list of image links.

**Directory:** [scripts/convert_images_to_lists.py](scripts/convert_images_to_lists.py)
